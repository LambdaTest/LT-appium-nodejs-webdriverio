# LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio
Sample repo to run app automation on real device on LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

- Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
- Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s [LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio
cd LT-appium-nodejs-webdriverio
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

For Linux / MacOS:

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
```
For Windows:

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```
> Note:
> - If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
> - Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

### Executing The Tests

If you are using an **iOS** app, the cURL command will generate an app URL for the corresponding iOS app and install the same for running the tests. You can either use our sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa) or upload your own app as discussed earlier.

**Step-4:** Navigate to the corresponding directory based on your app.

 - For android:
    ```bash
    cd android-sample
    ```
- For ios:
  ```bash
  cd ios-sample
  ```

**Step-5:** Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

**Step-6:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
npm run single
```
> Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
